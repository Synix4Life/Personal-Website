            <p>I'm working on a lot of different projects regarding different topics and programming languages. </p>
            <p>Hereby, I try to mainly build projects that bring some kind of value to me or my skills.</p>
            <p>As an example, the Go Note App focuses was created to have a sensible project to learn Go, as well as thighten my skills regarding HTML, CSS and JS. </p>
            <p>Further projects are available at <a href="https://github.com/Synix4Life">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
