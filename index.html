            About me
        </div>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
        <p>My name is Nils, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt (TU Darmstadt).</p> 
        <p>I'm passionate about software development, problem-solving, and constantly learning new technologies.</p>
        <p>Recently, I also choose to dive deeper into the area of IT- Security and Cryptography, picking specialized courses and expanding my knowledge alongside via tools like TryHackMe.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm preparing for my bachelor thesis, which will be the last necessary course to finish my bachelors degree.</p>

        <p>I'm currently using Linux Mint with Cinnamon desktop environment, but I plan to switch to a non- Debian distro, since I need a change and there exist compatibility issues (don't ask me what exactly).</p>
        <p>Planned is to swap to Artix Linux with KDE Plasma or i3wn, we will see.</p>

            Programming
        </div>
            <p>Im an active programmer.</p>
            <p>Thereby, I try to code projects that help me in some way, or are just fun.</p>
            <p>You can see a detailed view of my different projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

            Car Stuff
        </div>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on cars with friends.</p>
            <p>We focus mainly on visual tuning and detailing, painting interior and exterior parts, installing custom components, and giving each car a personal touch.</p>
            <p>I currently drive a 2011 Kia Ceed ED (Facelift). While it's not the fastest car, it's been reliable since I got it in 2022 and has served me well without any major issues.</p>
            <p>Currently, plans are to repaint the rims for my summer wheels white and install a custom rear logo, as well as further vinyl.</p>

        <div class="subcaption">
            Speedcubing
        </div>
            <p>I'm a speedcuber, which means I solve Rubik's Cubes as quickly as possible using optimized algorithms and finger tricks.</p>
            <p>I focus mainly on 3x3, 4x4 and Skewb, but I can solve a lot of different puzzles (all WCA official cubes + some other shapes).</p>
            <p>While I've done it actively, meaning I went to official competitions, I have recently focused on other things. Therefore, I'm not attending official competitions anymore and I'm also not planning to go any time soon.</p>
            <p>You can view my official results and rankings from my active time in the scene on <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019LANG04">my World Cube Association (WCA) profile</a>.</p>
